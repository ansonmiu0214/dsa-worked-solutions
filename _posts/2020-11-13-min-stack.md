## Problem

> Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and
> retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
> 
> * `push(x)` -- Push element x onto stack.
> * `pop()` -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
> * `top()` -- Get the top element.
> * `getMin()` -- Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.

## Some questions to ask

* Does this data structure need to be thread-safe?
* What types of elements does it support?
* What to return when calling `getMin` or `top` or `pop` for an empty stack?

## Approach

```python
class MinStack:

    def __init__(self):

        # Keep track of current min in separate stack.
        self._data = []
        self._min = []

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        """Push element 'x' onto stack."""

        self._data.append(x)

        # Update current min by comparing 'x' with previous min.
        # If stack was empty, then current min is 'x'.
        currMin = min(self._min[-1], x) if self._min else x
        self._min.append(currMin)
    
    def pop(self) -> None:
        """Removes the element on top of the stack."""

        # Sync state of 'data' stack and 'min' stack.
        self._data.pop()
        self._min.pop()

    def top(self) -> int:
        """Get the top element."""

        return self._data[-1]
    
    def getMin(self) -> int:
        """Retrive the minimum element in the stack."""
        
        return self._min[-1]
```

### Complexity

All operations run in constant time, but the `_min` stack does takes up additional space compared to a normal stack.

### Other approaches

A naive approach would be to just store the data in a normal stack and find the minimum on demand.
This would take up less space, but `getMin()` will run in at least
linear time.
